          <p><strong>Successful Negotiations</strong></p>
          <div class="padded">
            <p>Elizabeth was initially concerned about how her traditional face-to-face course would work
              online. The core activity of her course, which involved face-to-face mock negotiations
              between students, would be lost.</p>
            <p>Through the use of Zoom to record these sessions, students were able to review their
              negotiation performance and do deep reflective analysis of their performance afterwards. The
              instructor was able to review these recorded sessions and respond to student comments on
              their performance, and offer her own critique.</p>
            <p>This course culminated in a complex, multigroup negotiation session with multiple
              stakeholders conducted via Zoom.</p>

              was able to augment his course with synchronous online collaboration tools like Slack
              and Trello to conduct collaborative realtime brainstorming sessions that he could observe
              and
              participate in. Zoom allowed students to record these sessions and their product pitches,
              and share those recordings
              with other students for critique.</p>

      <div class="padded">
        <p>After developing the style guide for all of the courses in our program, I wanted to automate the
          process of converting course plans to Canvas LMS content. Since we were using Google Docs, I was
          able to develop a backend Javascript app that automated this process.</p>
        <p>This script treats the document like a table, iterates through the table's rows and cells, matches
          the cell content with a set of keywords, and wraps the cell's content in the appropriate HTML tags.

      <h2>Project Dashboard & Asset Tracker</h2>
      <div class="padded">
        <p>Multiple teams needed a way to catalog course assets (storyboards, module plans, supplemental documents,
          etc.) and track
          their status of completion, so I built this spreadsheet-based dashboard & asset tracker for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>This document allows us to list each asset and tag it's status according to a set of rules and numerical
          values
          indicating 'completeness.' Javascript then calculates a composite score for each course and it's
          associated
          assets,
          and tracks a rate of progress against the intended progress towards completion.</p>

        <p>I was excited to be a part of UW Madison's first foray into the MOOC space with a series of MOOCs we
          build between 2013-2016. I was the lead instructional designer for two MOOCs, listed below. These
          courses were seen by ~29,000 students around the world.</p>
        <p>The instructional design model here was unique; something I'd describe more as 'edutainment.' They
          were intended to give casual students entertaining and informative content without the commitment of
          deliverables or a timetable, and more serious students had the opportunity to participate in
          discussions and participate in hands-on activities.</p>
