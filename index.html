            <div class="padded">
              <p>Elizabeth was initially concerned about how her traditional face-to-face course would work
                online. The core activity of her course, which involved face-to-face mock negotiations
                between students, would be lost.</p>
              <p>Through the use of Zoom to record these sessions, students were able to review their
                negotiation performance and do deep reflective analysis of their performance afterwards. The
                instructor was able to review these recorded sessions and respond to student comments on
                their performance, and offer her own critique.</p>
              <p>This course culminated in a complex, multigroup negotiation session with multiple
                stakeholders conducted via Zoom.</p>

                and Trello to conduct collaborative realtime brainstorming sessions that he could observe
                and
                participate in. Zoom allowed students to record these sessions and their product pitches,
                and share those recordings
                with other students for critique.</p>

            <p>Multiple teams needed a way to catalog course assets (storyboards, module plans, supplemental documents,

              associated

            <p>The instructional design model here was unique; something I'd describe more as 'edutainment.' They
              were intended to give casual students entertaining and informative content without the commitment of
              deliverables or a timetable, and more serious students had the opportunity to participate in
