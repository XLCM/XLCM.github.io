                <h2>Course Design @ The University of Washington - Foster School of Business</h2>
                <p>I served as the lead instructional designer for both of these courses, which represent the typical
                    style of our projects.</p>
                <ul style="list-style: none;">

                                Negotiations</a></strong>
                        <p>Elizabeth was initially concerned about how her traditional face-to-face course would work
                            online. The core activity of her course, which involved face-to-face mock negotiations
                            between students, would be lost.</p>
                        <p>Through the use of Zoom to record these sessions, students were able to review their
                            negotiation performance and do deep reflective analysis of their performance afterwards. The
                            instructor was able to review these recorded sessions and respond to student comments on
                            their performance, and offer her own critique.</p>
                        <p>This course culminated in a complex, multigroup negotiation session with multiple
                            stakeholders conducted via Zoom.</p>

                            and Trello to conduct collaborative realtime brainstorming sessions that he could observe
                            and
                            participate in. Zoom allowed students to record these sessions and their product pitches,
                            and share those recordings
                            with other students for critique.</p>

                <h2>Course Build Automation</h2>
                <p>After developing the style guide for all of the courses in our program, I wanted to automate the
                    process of converting course plans to Canvas LMS content. Since we were using Google Docs, I was
                    able to develop a backend Javascript app that automated this process.</p>
                <p>This script treats the document like a table, iterates through the table's rows and cells, matches
                    the cell content with a set of keywords, and wraps the cell's content in the appropriate HTML tags.

                <p>Multiple teams needed a way to catalog course assets (storyboards, module plans, supplemental documents, etc.) and track 
                    their status of completion, so I built this spreadsheet-based dashboard & asset tracker for this purpose.</p>
                <p>This document allows us to list each asset and tag it's status according to a set of rules and numerical values 
                    indicating 'completeness.'  Javascript then calculates a composite score for each course and it's associated assets, 
                    and tracks a rate of progress against the intended progress towards completion.</p>

                <h2>Course Design @ UW-Madison</h2>
                <p>I was excited to be a part of UW Madison's first foray into the MOOC space with a series of MOOCs we
                    build between 2013-2016. I was the lead instructional designer for two MOOCs, listed below. These
                    courses were seen by ~29,000 students around the world.</p>
                <p>The instructional design model here was unique; something I'd describe more as 'edutainment.' They
                    were intended to give casual students entertaining and informative content without the commitment of
                    deliverables or a timetable, and more serious students had the opportunity to participate in
                    discussions and participate in hands-on activities.</p>
