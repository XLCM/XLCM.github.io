<h4><strong>Understand the Structure of the Course:</strong></h4>
<br>
<img class="img-responsive" src="../img/tab_structure.png" width="889" height="42" alt="course organization">
<br>
<p>Each of the Units contain the following items, which you should complete in the order listed below:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><strong>Overview & Readings:</strong> Review the summary statement and learning goals for the Unit. The assigned textbook reading is also included on this tab.</li>
<li><strong>Lectures:</strong> Watch a series of lectures for each Unit. Each lecture segment contains a link to the video lecture, a close captioned version of the lecture, a written transcript, and a link to a downloadable .mp3 file.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Each Unit contains a Self-Assessment and a Discussion topic. First, complete the Self-Assessment and interpret your results with the included interpretation guide. Each Self-Assessment is designed to give you insight into how you relate to the concepts we'll discuss. Then, review the discussion prompt question and construct a response.  The discussions are designed to help you explore the concepts in a deeper, more personal way, and we hope that you'll learn something valuable about yourself as a leader and an organizational member.</li>
<li><strong>KNOWING Quiz:</strong> Each Unit contains a KNOWING Quiz, designed to test your understanding and retention of the concepts.  These quizzes typically contain 8 multiple-choice questions, and two short-answer essay questions.  In some cases, you will be prompted to read a brief Case Study to prepare for the Quizzes.</li>
<li><strong>DOING Activities:</strong>Each Unit contains a writing assignment, which you'll write and submit via Peerceptiv.</li>
</ul>
