<p><strong>This Unit is about Culture.</strong></p>
<p>The values, norms, and beliefs shared by an organization’s members can help the organization gain competitive advantage by developing and managing a strong, healthy culture. Each organization may choose a different type of culture. It is important to identify the primary functions of that culture, its major elements or characteristics, and how it can best be developed, shared, transmitted, maintained, and even changed to evolve with an organization, rather than against an organization.</p>

<p>Organizational culture is more than just the preference of the CEO or some Facebook-esque notion that all work can be done in beanbag chairs. It is a way for an organization to put a personal stamp on who they are and how they want to operate. It influences the organization’s identity both internally and externally and can drive success or be a hindrance.</p>

<p>What exactly is organizational culture? In this lecture we learn what it is – its primary functions and elements – as well as how new members can become acculturated. Culture shapes the perceptions of employees as they determine whether this organization is a good fit for them as well as the perceptions of potential customers as they consider engaging with the organization.</p>

<p>There are four primary culture outlined in the competing values framework. Organizational cultures can be different for each organization. An appropriate culture is based on the organization’s mission and vision statements, is aligned with their strategy, and drives success. Each organization needs to consider which type of culture should be cultivated such that it can serve them effectively.</p>

<p>Organizational culture: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Culture can be a tipping point in effectiveness and survival of an organization. But, when a culture emerges that is unhealthy or not aligned with the overall’s organization’s strategy, it can work against any chance of success. Here we look at Enron as an example of “the ugly.”</p>

<p>A strong organizational culture, which has a high level of agreement across members of the organization, is not necessarily a health one. So what exactly makes a strong, healthy culture? It’s important to consider the factors that influence both of these dimensions so that organizations can set themselves up for more effective, successful practices and communicate the appropriate values, norms, and beliefs to an external audience.</p>

<p>Southwest Airlines is a great example of a good organizational culture. We’re able to look back at how they developed that culture and evolved over time, despite dramatic changes in the airline industry and turnover of personnel. Strong, healthy organizational cultures are rarely happenstance. They take consideration of a variety of factors and intentional decision-making as well as serendipity.</p>

<p>But can you really control an organizational culture if it’s determined by the collective agreement of an organization’s members? Tony Hsieh of Zappos thinks so and his work to take the necessary time and measures to develop and roll-out a strong, healthy organizational culture seems to have paid off.</p>

<p>Hiring the right people is far more important than just hiring the most skilled people. Individuals hold their own values, norms, and beliefs and bring those with them to an organization. Similarly, getting rid of a “bad egg” here or there can help lighten the organizational culture and shape it to grow in the right direction.</p>

<p>How do we share our organizational culture? Stories, statements, slogans, sayings, symbols, legends, myths, heroes, and more all help an organizational culture thrive and become ingrained in every aspect of an organization’s functions.</p>

<p>Interpret your results using <a href="../files/Unit2/Unit2-SelfAssessmentInterpretation.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>this interpretation guide</strong>.</a></p>
<p>Then, consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have dreamed about working for Organization X for years, and you will finally have an interview tomorrow morning. You were so excited until your roommate said that she heard the organization has a “crummy culture.” She couldn’t provide any specifics, but this has you concerned.</p>
<p>You have completed the self-assessment, which identifies the type of organizational culture you prefer.  Based on this understanding, write one initial post that identifies as many strategies as you can think of to find out whether your ‘dream organization’ has a culture that is compatible with your preferred culture.  Also, identify the potential ‘costs’ to both you and the organization if your values do not fit with those of the organization.  Initial posts should be a minimum of 250 words.</p>
<p>For two reply posts, evaluate the suggestions of your colleagues. Do you agree with the strategies they suggest, and the potential costs they've identified?  If so, explain why. If not, explain why and offer an alternate suggestion. Citing research to support your opinions is encouraged.</p>
