<p><strong>This Unit is about Entrepreneurship </strong></p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is a hot topic, particularly as we consider it within the context of the development of jobs and the creation of new businesses. Startup and small businesses account for the majority of US jobs and play a significant role in developing markets. Entrepreneurship comes in all shapes and sizes and goes far beyond the iconic examples, like Uber, Facebook, and Twitter, coming out of Silicon Valley. Today we have startups with a social mission, lifestyle companies, family-owned companies, crowdfunded companies, and many other types. This unit is aimed to examine the underlying principles behind effective entrepreneurial management.</p>

<p>Stories can be inspiring and motivating, particularly for individuals interested in creating and/or joining a startup. And we need these stories in order to get through the hard times with our startups or gain the courage to pursue an entrepreneurial opportunity.

<div class="col-sm-2 text-right"><h5><strong><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time glyphpad" aria-hidden="true"></span> 15:55m</strong></h5></div>
</div>
<p>Entrepreneurs are often seen as having the “it” factor or being individuals who pursue and get a thrill from risk. But research has considered and debunked a number of these myths; we take a look at those myths in this topic. Additionally, success is a nebulous concept, especially when we think about entrepreneurship. What does success look like? How is it packaged? And what does it take to become successful?</p>

<p>The entrepreneurial process is modeled through three primary factors: opportunity, resources, and team. Additionally we study the role of the founder, uncertainty, ambiguity, the market, and other important considerations. Through this we are better able to study entrepreneurship from a research perspective and become better practitioners.</p>

<p>Innovation must be considered in tandem with risk. To what extent does an entrepreneurial opportunity encourage the creation of a new and/or different product and what level of risk does that innovation bring? We have heard the phrase “high risk, high reward,” which particularly applies here. In order to successfully manage the entrepreneurial process, individuals must consider the primary mistakes usually made, common challenges, how to define a path to success, and how to ultimately obtain value from the venture.</p>

<p>Show me the money! Before entrepreneurs can seek profit, they must first have the financial resources to fund their new venture. There are a number of ways startups can be funded. Often “friends, family, and fools” help out during the initial stages of a startup to give it the necessary runway before other types of funding present themselves.</p>

<p>Financial resources aren’t the only resources that are valuable to a startup. Other types of resources, like legitimacy, advisors, and networks, can be integral to entrepreneurial success. Here we look at each of these types of resources in turn, considering their role in the overall organization and the power of good resources.</p>

<p>Corporate entrepreneurship, or intrapreneurship, happens within an existing organization. In this lecture we consider the differences between intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, how organizations can encourage intrapreneurship, the role of employees in the intrapreneurship process, and some issues associated with this type of entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Start with taking the <strong><a href="https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4MXou68IzooOppP" target="_blank">"Adaptability"</a> Self-Assessment</strong>.</p>
<p>Interpret your results using <a href="../files/Unit7/Unit7-SelfAssessmentInterpretation.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>this interpretation guide</strong>.</a></p>
<p>Then, consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume that you have recently graduated from college and have just been offered a job at Zappos. Zappos may be large but it is very much an entrepreneurial firm. You may recall, from earlier units in this course, that Zappos has a very unique organization culture and structure. Recently, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh escalated the use of “holacracy” at Zappos, which is a very non-hierarchical management approach that emphasizes self-management rather than a traditional structure where everyone reports to a boss who in turn reports to a boss. Fourteen percent of the Zappos work force recently chose to leave after expressing displeasure with this organizational model. Many of the departures were attributed, at least in part, to preference for different organizational expectation.</p>
<p>Review your self-assessment results on adaptability. Given your results, would you be a good match or a poor match for a job at Zappos? </p>
<p>For your initial post:</p>
<p>If Zappos would be a good match for you, explain how / why your adaptability results would facilitate your success and happiness. Provide one specific suggestion for what you would look for in other organizations that would fit your adaptability style.  If this would be a bad match, explain how / why your adaptability results would hinder your success and happiness at Zappos. Provide one specific suggestion for an action you could take to make yourself a better match for Zappos.</p>
<p>For your reply posts:</p>
<p>Find a post from a colleague who does think that Zappos would be a good fit for them.  Do you agree with their suggestion for how to identify an organization that would be a good fit for them, based on their adaptability style?  If so, explain why. If not, explain why and offer another suggestion for identifying organizations that would work for them.</p>
<p>Then, find a post from a colleague who does not think that Zappos would be a good fit for them.  Do you agree with their suggestion for how to make themselves a better match for Zappos, based on their adaptability style?  If so, explain why. If not, explain why and offer an alternate strategy for adapting themselves to an organization like Zappos.</p>
