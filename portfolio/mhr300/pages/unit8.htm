<p><strong>This Unit is about Change Management</strong></p>
<p>Organizations survive and thrive through the generation and execution of good ideas. Unfortunately, the majority of good ideas fail to achieve their objectives because the change process is not well managed. You can increase the value you bring to an organization not only by generating good ideas, but also by developing skills to manage the change process.</p>

<p>This unit takes you through the essential elements of change management and then helps you build skills through a DOING assignment focused on how you would manage change based on information from a real organization.</p>

<p><strong>At the end of this Unit, you should be able to:</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Change agents would like every member in the organization to support change but this is probably not realistic. Instead, attention needs to be on the key stakeholders; these are people who are essential to change success. In this session, you will learn how to conduct a stakeholder analysis and use this knowledge to complete the DOING activity for the week.</p>

<p>One overriding emotional response to change, even when people think change is a good idea, is stress. This section highlights the major stressors associated with change and the various ways people can react when faced with change.</p>

<p>Stakeholder analysis allows us to identify the behaviors needed to make change successful. In the last unit, we identified a wide variety of reactions to change. In this unit we learn how to identify a gap between the behaviors we need for successful change and actual behaviors demonstrated by stakeholders.</p>

<p>Start with taking the <strong><a href="https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_57Gs9lDVpEtpRzL" target="_blank">Change Self-Assessment</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Interpret your results using <a href="../files/Unit8/Unit8-SelfAssessmentInterpretation.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>this interpretation guide</strong>.</a></p>
<p>Then, consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume that you are about to graduate from college and have just been offered a job that is closely related to your major by T-Mobile. Having done several course projects on T-Mobile, you are quite familiar with the company’s strategic objectives, structure, culture, and core business practices. You have liked almost everything you have observed about T-Mobile and have always thought that you would be a great fit with this company that has prided itself on being different from the competition.</p>
<p>Two days after you receive the job offer, you see an article in the Wall Street Journal titled “T-Mobile to Acquire Bigger Competitor Verizon in a Leveraged Buyout.” The T-Mobile CEO is quoted in the article saying, “This will transform our company. Everything we do to achieve success is up for grabs. We are going to create an even more exciting mission statement, a more challenging vision for the future, and a more aggressive business approach to become the biggest and the most profitable company in our industry.”</p>
<p>Review your self-assessment results on attitude toward change. Given your results, how would you be likely to react to the statement from the T-Mobile CEO? Explain how your attitude toward change results would impact your reaction. Given the situation and your self-assessment results, would you now be even more excited about accepting the job at T-Mobile or prefer a job with a different company that is likely to have a more stable short-term future? Briefly explain your preference.</p>

<p><strong>Team Stakeholder Analysis Project</strong></p>

<p>Project Focus: Each team will conduct a stakeholder analysis related to an impending or potential change in an organizations identified by team members. The organizational change can be of any type as long as it is meaningful for the organization (e.g., an acquisition, a restructuring, creation of a new compensation system, introduction of a new software system, a change in leadership, a new product line).</p>

<p>This paper should include the following features:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>A description of the organization (or unit) in which the change will occur.</strong> This should include mission and vision statements for the organization (or unit) involved and the strategic objectives expected to be impacted by the change.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>A description of the change.</strong> Identify the nature of the change, the primary reasons for the change, and the measurable criteria against which the success of the change should be assessed. This section should be descriptive only.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Identification of key stakeholders.</strong> Identify the key stakeholders and briefly explain why each identified stakeholder is a key stakeholder.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Needed stakeholder behavior.</strong> Briefly describe the behavior needed from each key stakeholder to facilitate the success of the change and explain how this behavior would facilitate success of the change.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Expected stakeholder behavior.</strong> Describe the behavior expected from each key stakeholder if not managed and the causes underlying this expected behavior.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Potential gaps.</strong> Identify anticipated gaps between the needed stakeholder behavior identified in Part 4 and the expected behavior described in Part 5. Describe how the most significant of these gaps could hinder the success of the change.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Plan to close one of the gaps.</strong> Identify at least one action for a significant gap identified in Part 6 that would help close the gap. Briefly explain why the recommended action should close the identified gap. In other words, tell a story that explains how/why your plan should work.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>
<p>Write a comprehensive 2000 - 2400 word document that addresses each of the steps. Be clear, concise, and thorough in your response. Make sure to explain why you gave the answers you did. Make sure to include the web address for the organization you chose to evaluate.</p>
<p>Use this <a href="../files/Unit8/Unit8-DoingRubric.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>grading rubric</strong></a> to guide the development of your paper, and to understand how your paper will be evaluated.</p>
