      <h2 id="headline">Overview</h2>
      <p>Terence Kemp McKenna (November 16, 1946 â€“ April 3, 2000) was an American ethnobotanist,
        mystic, psychonaut, lecturer, author, and an advocate for the responsible use of naturally
        occurring psychedelic plants. He spoke and wrote about a variety of subjects, including
        psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language,
        philosophy, culture, technology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of human
        consciousness. He was called the "Timothy Leary of the '90s", "one of the leading
        authorities on the ontological foundations of shamanism", and the "intellectual voice of
        rave culture".</p>

      <h2>Compelling Ideas</h2>

      <h3>On Psychedelics</h3>
      <p>Terence McKenna advocated the exploration of altered states of mind via the ingestion of naturally occurring
        psychedelic substances; for example, and in particular, as facilitated by the ingestion of high doses of
        psychedelic mushrooms, ayahuasca, and DMT, which he believed was the apotheosis of the psychedelic experience.
        He was less enthralled with synthetic drugs, stating, "I think drugs should come from the natural world and be
        use-tested by shamanically orientated cultures ... one cannot predict the long-term effects of a drug produced
        in a laboratory."</p>
      <p>McKenna always stressed the responsible use of psychedelic plants, saying:</p>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>"Experimenters should be very careful. One must build up to the experience. These are bizarre dimensions of
            extraordinary power and beauty. There is no set rule to avoid being overwhelmed, but move carefully, reflect
            a great deal, and always try to map experiences back onto the history of the race and the philosophical and
            religious accomplishments of the species. All the compounds are potentially dangerous, and all compounds, at
            sufficient doses or repeated over time, involve risks. The library is the first place to go when looking
            into taking a new compound."</p>

      <h3>On Organized Religion</h3>
      <p>McKenna was opposed to Christianity and most forms of organized religion or guru-based forms of spiritual
        awakening, favouring shamanism, which he believed was the broadest spiritual paradigm available, stating that:
      </p>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>"What I think happened is that in the world of prehistory all religion was experiential, and it was based
            on the pursuit of ecstasy through plants. And at some time, very early, a group interposed itself between
            people and direct experience of the 'Other.' This created hierarchies, priesthoods, theological systems,
            castes, ritual, taboos. Shamanism, on the other hand, is an experiential science that deals with an area
            where we know nothing. It is important to remember that our epistemological tools have developed very
            unevenly in the West. We know a tremendous amount about what is going on in the heart of the atom, but we
            know absolutely nothing about the nature of the mind."</p>

      <h3>On Technology</h3>
      <p>During the final years of his life and career, McKenna became very engaged in the theoretical realm of
        technology. He was an early proponent of the technological singularity and in his last recorded public talk,
        Psychedelics in the age of intelligent machines, he outlined ties between psychedelics, computation technology,
        and humans. He also became enamored with the Internet, calling it "the birth of [the] global mind", believing it
        to be a place where psychedelic culture could flourish.</p>

      <h3>The Stoned Ape Theory</h3>
      <p>In his book Food of the Gods, McKenna proposed that the transformation from humans' early ancestors Homo
        erectus to the species Homo sapiens mainly had to do with the addition of the mushroom Psilocybe cubensis in its
        diet, an event that according to his theory took place in about 100,000 BCE (which is when he believed that the
        species diverged from the genus Homo). McKenna based his theory on the main effects, or alleged effects,
        produced by the mushroom while citing studies by Roland Fischer et al. from the late 1960s to early 1970s.</p>
      <p>McKenna stated that due to the desertification of the African continent at that time, human forerunners were
        forced from the increasingly shrinking tropical canopy in search of new food sources. He believed they would
        have been following large herds of wild cattle whose dung harbored the insects that, he proposed, were
        undoubtedly part of their new diet, and would have spotted and started eating Psilocybe cubensis, a dung-loving
        mushroom often found growing out of cowpats.</p>
      <p>Therefore, according to McKenna, access to and ingestion of mushrooms was an evolutionary advantage to humans'
        omnivorous hunter-gatherer ancestors, also providing humanity's first religious impulse. He believed that
        psilocybin mushrooms were the "evolutionary catalyst" from which language, projective imagination, the arts,
        religion, philosophy, science, and all of human culture sprang.</p>
